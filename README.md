# ðŸ“œ Recommended Order + Brief Guide:

## 1. **DashBoardView.java**

âž” Dashboard is the heart of every app. It's like the "home page" after login.  
**What it shows?**  
âž” Welcome text, quick stats (e.g., "You have 3 tasks today"), maybe mini charts later.  
**Tips:**

- Later you can make it fancy with charts ðŸ“ˆ after base work done.

**Why second?**  
âž” Before creating a project or task, we need to have teams ready!  
**What it shows?**  
âž” Form with team name, members selection maybe (for now, keep it simple: just team name).

## 3. **CreateProjectView.java**
**Why third?**  
âž” Projects are made by teams. Logically, create teams â†’ create projects.

## 6. **KanbanBoardView.java**
**Why sixth?**  
âž” After we have tasks, we can **visually manage** them using Kanban (To-Do, Doing, Done).  
**What it shows?**  
âž” Three columns ("To-Do", "In Progress", "Done"), draggable tasks later (basic list now).  
**Tips:**  
- First create simple **VBox columns** for each stage.
- Later, you can drag-drop tasks for pro vibes ðŸ§ .

# ðŸŒŸ Pro Dev Tips (if you want to go even crazier later):

- After each **Create** view (team/project/task), add a **ListView** to show recently created items.
- Later add **validation** (like "Team name can't be empty") for pro feels.
- Always keep UI **consistent**: same padding, margins, button styles across views.  
- Save little dummy data in Java Lists/ArrayLists for now â†’ database later, inshaAllah.
